# Text-Summarization
The dataset produced in this approach consists of 2000 research articles out of 2500 after preprocessing in pdf format, having three attributes. One of the three attributes is the title of the research article, and the other attributes are text and headline. The collection of data is considered an essential step of the study, which is not only based on collecting random data but gathering valuable and relevant for the research study is the primary task data collection. The dataset used in the proposed approach is not taken from any literature as a new dataset is created manually to summarize research articles in PDF format, mainly on the internet. Making a new dataset means there are no datasets of research articles publicly available for text summarization. Thus, the data is collected with the help of google scholar and crowdsourcing. The collected data has almost 2500 articles from 2005 to 2021.
