In this paper, we developed a comprehensive risk model for predicting heart failure mortality with a high level of accuracy using an improved random survival forest (iRSF). Utilizing a novel split rule and stopping criterion, the proposed iRSF was able to identify more accurate predictors to separate survivors and nonsurvivors and thus improve discrimination ability. Based on the public MIMIC II clinical database with 8 059 patients, 32 risk factors, including demographics, clinical, laboratory information, and medications, were analyzed and used to develop the risk model for patients with heart failure. Compared with previous studies, more critical laboratory predictors were identified that could reveal difficult-to-manage comorbidities, including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, serum creatine, blood urea nitrogen, and their inherent effects on events; these were determined to be critical indicators for predicting heart failure mortality with the proposed iRSF. The experimental results showed that the developed risk model was superior to those used in previous studies and the conventional random survival forest-based model with an out-of-bag C-statistic value of 0.821. Therefore, the developed iRSF-based risk model could serve as a valuable tool for clinicians in heart failure mortality prediction.\n","'''\n","string = run_summarization(text_str)\n","print(string)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n"," \n","Identification of different risk factors and early prediction of mortality for patients with heart failure are crucial for guiding clinical decision-making in Intensive care unit cohorts.

The main issue with most of the feature-based ATS methods is to find optimal feature weights for sentence scoring to optimize the quality of summary. Voting-based methods are sensitive to initial ranking process. We proposed reciprocal ranking-based sentence scoring approach that alleviates the feature weighting and initial ranking problem. The proposed approach uses a specific prominent set of features for initial ranking that further enhance the performance. Experimental results on Document Understating Conference 2002 data-set using ROUGE evaluation matrices shows that our proposed method performs better as compared to other voting-based methods.\n","'''\n","ref5='''\n","Automatic text summarization is the process of generating a summary by condensing text document by a computer machine.

VANET is mainly used for the construction of an intelligent transport system. VANET enables communication between the vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I). VANET can be used to coordinate the traffic, improve safety measures, support the drivers for hassle-free driving. It plays a major role in building smart cities in the near future. VANET is vulnerable to a number of security issues among which the DoS attack is a major part. DoS attack in VANET involves a malicious node flooding a huge amount of traffic using spoofed identities. This, in turn, may disrupt the services of vehicles in the network. The detection of the attack becomes very difficult due to fake identities. The detection scheme uses a cuckoo filter and IP detection technique to detect the attack in the network. Once the attack is detected it generates a broadcast message to all the other vehicles that are present in the network.\n","'''\n","ref6='''\n","VANET is a subset of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) It enables communication between the vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure.

This is difficult due to variations in scale, pose, lighting, background, expression, hairstyle, and glasses. In this paper we present two methods for learning robust distance measures: (a) a logistic discriminant approach which learns the metric from a set of labelled image pairs (LDML) and (b) a nearest neighbour approach which computes the probability for two images to belong to the same class (MkNN). We evaluate our approaches on the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set, a large and very challenging data set of faces from Yahoo! News. The evaluation protocol for this data set defines a restricted setting, where a fixed set of positive and negative image pairs is given, as well as an unrestricted one, where faces are labelled by their identity. We are the first to present results for the unrestricted setting, and show that our methods benefit from this richer training data, much more so than the current state-of-the-art method. Our results of 79.3% and 87.5% correct for the restricted and unrestricted setting respectively, significantly improve over the current state-of-the-art result of 78.5%. Confidence scores obtained for face identification can be used for many applications e.g. clustering or recognition from a single training example.

It is suitable for many learning scenarios, such as image classification, fraud detection, web mining, and text classification. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach based on assumptions that features are independent of each other and that their weights are equally important. However, in practice, features may be interrelated. In that case, such assumptions may cause a dramatic decrease in performance. In this study, by following preprocessing steps, a Feature Dependent Naive Bayes (FDNB) classification method is proposed. Features are included for calculation as pairs to create dependence between one another. This method was applied to the software defect prediction problem and experiments were carried out using widely recognized NASA PROMISE data sets. The obtained results show that this new method is more successful than the standard Naive Bayes approach and that it has a competitive performance with other feature-weighting techniques. A further aim of this study is to demonstrate that to be reliable, a learning model must be constructed by using only training data, as otherwise misleading results arise from the use of the entire data set.\n","'''\n","ref9='''\n","Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach based on assumptions that features are independent of each other.

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is applied to the input Electroencephalography (EEG) signal to extract the features of MI. After transformation, we consider the real part and imaginary part of the transformed signal to exploit magnitude and phase information at the same time. This feature is fed to the CNN having one convolution layer, one max-pooling layer and one fully connected layer. The classification accuracy is tested on two public BCI datasets: BCI competition IV dataset IIb and BCI competition II dataset III.
